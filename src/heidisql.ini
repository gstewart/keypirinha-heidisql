# Allow this version of HeidiSQL to be referenced.
# * If this value is false (i.e.: "no"; without quotes), the plugin will not

# The path where this instance of HeidiSQL is located.
# * This value can be empty or a path to the installation directory of HeidiSQL.
# * If this value is empty, the plugin will try to automatically detect where
#   HeidiSQL is installed.
# * The auto-detection steps are as follows:
#   * Try to detect if HeidiSQL has been installed with the official installer by
#     digging into system's registry
#   * If not found, search the Start Menu for an item named "HeidiSQL" that points
#     to an existing "HEIDISQL.EXE" executable file
#   * If not found, search for a "HeidiSQL" directory in %PROGRAMFILES%
#   * If not found, search for a "HeidiSQL" directory in %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%
#   * If not found, search for a "HEIDISQL.EXE" file pointed the PATH environment
#     variable.
#   * If not found, auto-detection is aborted
# * Default: empty value

# * This value can be empty or a path to the installation directory of HeidiSQL.
# * If this value is empty, the plugin will try to automatically detect where
#   HeidiSQL is installed. As a consequence, it is more optimized to manually
#   specify HeidiSQL's path than letting the plugin to auto-detect it.
# * The auto-detection steps are as follows:
#   * Search for a "HeidiSQL.exe" file pointed the PATH environment
#     variable.
